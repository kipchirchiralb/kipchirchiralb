# Hi, I'm Albert!



I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** with a strong focus on **Node.js** and expertise in building scalable web applications using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

As an **instructor at EldoHub**, I empower young people with core digital skills, teaching them to thrive in the tech world through hands-on training in programming and software development. I love helping new developers build their first projects and sharing my knowledge to inspire the next generation of tech innovators.
